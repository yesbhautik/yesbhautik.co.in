I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be involved in the start-ups, business, open-source community, creating tools and resources. I love to help to creative founders, brands, and build something together that help them grow. I realize that many of you, like myself, are enthusiastic about building something or contributing to open source projects but may be unsure where to begin. That I actually also struggled with along the way.

So if you're curious about delving into startup/business ecosystem, amazing projects, but feel uncertain about taking the first step, or if you're already involved and have questions about your journey, I would be delighted to chat with you and share my experiences and insights to help you find your way.

### Quick Chat

I want to keep the conversation easy, open, and accessible. You can you use the link below to book a 5min chat with me. I deeply value my time, and I'm sure you do too, so I would appreciate it if you come prepared with some initial research and questions in mind. I am looking forward have a short while meaningful chat with you!

> Note that I might not always be able to respond immediately and can possibly miss some inquiries. Do check back if the booking becomes **accepted**, otherwise I might not have seen it yet. If I missed your inquiry, feel free to book again in another time slot.

### Consultancy

I am fairly limited in terms of the time I have, but I understand that more complex topics or in-depth discussions may require a longer time frame. If needed, I'm happy to do a 60min consultancy call to help.
